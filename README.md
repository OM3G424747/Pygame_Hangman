# Hangman Game Development Project

## Early test project

The purpose of this project was to learn python 3 while developing a basic version of hangman.
Since then I've learned a lot more about game development and programming
This project still needs to be refactored to adhere to PEP8.

Current focus points:

1) - Refactor code to use only snake case
2) - Refine code to adhere to PEP8
3) - Remove all magic numbers from code 
4) - Update game logic to improve performance


## Current state of the game

This game currently includes most of the functionality planned for the final version.
Features currently planned for future versions include

1) - Adding "Snowman" alternative switch for a more family friendly alternative 
2) - Adding scaling for different screen sizes 
3) - Adding audio feedback
4) - Improving CPU AI and UI

## ETA on updates

Currently my older pygame project is taking priority over this project.
Hangman will only be updated after my other project has been fully refactored to meet industry standards.
